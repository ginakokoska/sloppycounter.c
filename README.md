# sloppycounter.c

This program intends to show a method of updating a global counter using local counters of multiple threads shown in the book 'Operating Systems' by Remzi H. & Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau.
Proofing that the GC values accuracy and the overhead time are dependent on the chosen threshold value S.
A large threshold leads to small OVH but inaccurete GC value and vice versa.
